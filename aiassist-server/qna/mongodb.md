To add MongoDB to your Node.js project, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the MongoDB driver for Node.js using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command in your project directory:

   ```
   npm install mongodb
   ```

2. Require the MongoDB module in your Node.js file where you want to use it:

   ```javascript
   const MongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient;
   ```

3. Connect to your MongoDB database by creating a new MongoClient instance and specifying the connection URL:

   ```javascript
   const url = "mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase"; // Replace 'mydatabase' with your database name
   MongoClient.connect(url, function (err, client) {
   	if (err) {
   		console.log("Error connecting to MongoDB:", err);
   	} else {
   		console.log("Connected to MongoDB successfully!");
   		// You can perform database operations here
   		client.close(); // Close the connection when you're done
   	}
   });
   ```

4. You can now perform various database operations using the `client` object, such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data. Refer to the MongoDB Node.js driver documentation for more details on how to use the driver: https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/

Remember to replace `'mydatabase'` with the name of your actual database, and `'localhost:27017'` with the appropriate MongoDB server address and port.
